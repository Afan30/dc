        <h2>Built to Solve Real Hiring Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Born out of frustration with traditional hiring processes, Doltec was
          founded by industry veterans and technologists who saw the need for a
          single, intelligent recruitment platform. From day one, we’ve focused
          on removing friction and maximizing visibility for every stakeholder
          in the hiring chain.
